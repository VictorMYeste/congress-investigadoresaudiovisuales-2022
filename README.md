## Overview

This paper presents an exploratory study about the use, performance, and main character-istics of the official Twitter hashtags of movie premieres in the USA. Almost weekly, a dif-ferent group of movies is released for the first time in the USA, trying to get the attention and interest of the audience to watch them in theaters or via Video-on-Demand (VoD). From four consecutive movie release dates, data about the Twitter official hashtags of the movies were gathered in three time points: one week before, the same week, and one week after every movie release. The objective is to study how participation in Twitter con-versation fluctuates around movie premieres and the users’ characteristics. Suitable met-rics to learn this are the volume of tweets, the ratio of retweets and favorites, and sentiment analysis. Using an exploratory point of view, some conclusions about the use, perfor-mance, and trend analysis have been gathered to justify a further study involving a much more extended period.
